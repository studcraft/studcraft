# OpenSpec Workflow

StudCraft uses OpenSpec for design discussions and architectural decisions.

OpenSpec stores:

- Design proposals
- Design decisions
- Historical rationale
- Future ideas

The `/docs` directory stores only the current accepted rules — the ruleset. Every change to a ruleset file (`/docs/*.md`) must go through an OpenSpec proposal first. This is mandatory; see Git Workflow below.

See `openspec/config.yaml` for per-artifact rules.

# Git Workflow

Mandatory rules. No exceptions.

- No document changes anywhere in the repo (`/docs`, `README.md`, `CODE_OF_DESIGN.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `system/*.md`) may be committed directly to `main` or `develop`. Always use a branch.
- Ruleset changes (`/docs/*.md`) additionally require an OpenSpec proposal first, on its own dedicated branch (see `openspec/config.yaml`). Non-ruleset docs (README, AGENTS.md, `system/*.md`, etc.) need a branch but not a proposal.
- If asked to edit a ruleset document directly on `main`/`develop`, or without a proposal: stop, do not make the change, and tell the user why.
